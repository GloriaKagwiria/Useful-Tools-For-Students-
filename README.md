## VS Code
<!--[Franklin Nzioki] Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a free, lightweight and very powerful source code editor developed by Microsoft. It works with Windows, macOS, Linux and web browsers so is cross-platform and perfect for both beginners as well as more advanced developers. Based on the open-source Code - OSS repository, VS Code was built and is maintained by Microsoft with contributions from the community Built in JavaScript and Typescript Literal Programming Building modern web and cloud applications.
### Key Uses of VS Code:
#####Code Editing & Development:
For languages like JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, C++, HTML, and CSS, Visual Studio Code offers syntax highlighting, code refactoring,   intelligent code completion (IntelliSense), and snippets.
####Debugging:
Step-by-step code execution, breakpoint setting, and real-time variable examination are made possible by the built-in support for debugging Node.js applications and the extension's integration with debuggers for other languages.
####Version control:
Users can view changes, commit, push, pull, and manage code repositories all within the editor thanks to native Git integration.
####Integrated Terminal: 
You can do command-line operations without ever leaving the editor thanks to an integrated terminal that supports Bash, Zsh, PowerShell, WSL, and other shells.
####Flexibility: 
Visual Studio Code can be expanded to include more languages and frameworks.
####Remote Development: 
Developers may easily work on distant computers, containers, or Linux environments with extensions like Remote-SSH, Remote-Containers, and Remote-WSL.
####Web & Cloud Development:
VS Code is a popular tool for creating websites, APIs, and cloud-native apps since it is optimized for web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSX/React).
####Collaboration:
Real-time collaborative coding sessions with other developers are made possible by features like Live Share.
####Cross-Platform:
accessible via browser (vscode.dev) for instant access without installation, as well as Windows, macOS, and Linux.
